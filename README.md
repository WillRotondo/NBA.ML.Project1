# NBA.ML.Project1
Thank you to JUSTINAS CIRTAUTAS for this dataset via Kaggle! 
In this project, I used the pandas and numpy libraries to parse through the data to then use a series of ML algorithms to predict player height and weight over future draft years. 
I experimented with Linear regression, polynomial regression, KNN, and random forest regression for my prediction algorithm, eventually landing on polynomial regression using sklearn library
I also used matplotlib from pyplot to visualize the data!
